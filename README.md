# Calander-Fix

This calander has been coded to display a series of text inputs to allow the user to type and submit their daily calander schedule.

The calander will also display the current time and date formatted in ddd MMM do.

While we are using a 24 hour clock formatted through the moments library to compare the current time to the time data we had given each input box.

The information will be saved on their local storage once the user clicks on the targetted save button and be displayed back so that when the page is refreshed their calander schedule will remain. 

The calander color will update upon refresh and is coded so that the current time slot is highlighted in red, the future times are highlighted in green and anything that has passed will be grayed out.
